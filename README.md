# HR Analytics Dashboard – ReDI School Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This HR analytics project was developed as part of the **Data Analytics course at ReDI School (2024 Fall)**. The objective was to analyze and visualize HR-related data using Power BI, and generate actionable insights for areas such as recruitment, retention, diversity, and workforce planning.

The dataset was AI-generated and provided by the instructor.

> This was a group project. The Power BI dashboard included here reflects the portion I contributed to.
